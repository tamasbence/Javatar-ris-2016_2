Aspects of inspection

We defined 9 criteria according to IEEE Std 29148-2011:
- Necessary: If it is removed or deleted, a deficiency will exist, which cannot be fulfilled by other capabilities
- Implementation Free: Avoids placing unnecessary constraints on the design
- Unambiguous: It can be interpreted in only one way; is simple and easy to understand
- Consistent: Is free of conflicts with other requirements
- Complete: Needs no further amplification 
- Singular: Includes only one requirement with no use of conjunctions
- Feasible: technically achievable, fits within system constraints
- Traceable: Upwards traceable to the stakeholder statements; downwards traceable to other documents
- Verifiable: Has the means to prove that the system satisfies the specified requirement

Three members of our team (Zoltan Lux, Balazs Nagy, Mate Stogica) inspected these - 4-5 criteria per person â€“ and the forth member (Bence Tamas) wrote the report about the identified problems. So a few but not so trivial criteria were inspected more than once, in this way we tried to make sure not to miss anything important.
