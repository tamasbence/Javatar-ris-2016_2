The SafetyLogicImpl class implements the safety functions of TSM. It receives and stores status messages from the monitored sections and turnout, and also the heartbeat messages from neighbouring TSMs. 
The class contains the decision-making logic (based on local and distributed decisions) which is executed whenever a received message implies new safety conditions,  i.e. a status change is recognized. Based on these decisions it sends the appropriate control signals to the monitored sections. Currently it is not responsible for sending heartbeat messages to other TSMs.
